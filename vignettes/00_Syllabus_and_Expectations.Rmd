# For today, we will be talking about expectations

This course will cover the basics of: Data management in a computational framework.

_Why_ do we want to do that?  
    - Convenience: The computer is much more effective at doing repetitive tasks than our brains are  
    - Reproducibility: A computer stores records of what we have done more effectively than our brains do  
    - Flexibility: When you read a paper, and they're using the most cutting edge tools, those tools are probably computational tools.
